# Introduction

Chapsnat is a mockup app which intent was to resemble the actual snapchat app to give scholars a better idea how it is built. The project is built in React Native, and also uses an external chat library and firebase database for it to have the ability to send and receive messages from different users. 

# Main Features

* [x] A friends tab navigation that allows users to create a chat room while also being able to choose which users are allowed to join.
* [x] A chat tab navigation where users can see and select rooms available where they can go in and chat with others. 
* [x] A profile navigation tab where users can make changes to their profile, such as changing their profile image and name. Users can also sign out which immediately takes them back to the register/sign in screen. 

# Installation & Setup

## Install

1. To get started, fork or clone the repo and then within the terminal inside the repo run:

```
yarn install
```

2. Next, you want to make sure to install the Expo app through your phone before being able to view the prototype. Additional info regarding Expo can be found down below under the 'Technologies Used' section.

## Set up

1. Within your terminal inside the repo, run:

```
expo start
```

2. Open the camera of your phone and scan the barcode from the link that opens immediately into your browser after running the command above. This should take you towards the Expo app to be able to view the project within your phone. 
3. Wait until Expo loads the project entirely. Then, register within the app and you'll find a tab bar icon below that will allow you to navigate towards the different main features from the app.
